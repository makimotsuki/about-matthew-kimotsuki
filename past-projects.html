        <p class="blurb" style = "font-family: Manrope;">  In this project, I made a prototype for a volunteering website for the SF Bike Kitchen. They had expressed a need to be able to track volunteering hours, and thus I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible interface. I built dynamic elements to mimic the functionality of hour tracking, and overall I was able to strengthen my understanding of front-end web development and put those skills to use in a real-world application.</p>

      <!-- National Parks Project -->
      <p style = "font-size: 30px; font-family: Manrope;">National Parks Website</p>
      <div class="card">
        <p class="blurb" style = "font-family: Manrope;">In this project, I made a website showcasing some of my favorite national parks using HTML and CSS. I very much enjoy hiking and the outdoors, and wanted to be able to share valuable information to others who might be interested in visiting these national parks. I included interactive flip cards, weather trends, the best time to go, and best hikes to go on, organizing it in an inuitive interface. I was able to strengthen my understanding of front-end web development while also working on something that I am very passionate about. </p>
